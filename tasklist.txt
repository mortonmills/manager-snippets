add diagram to readme
rename and break up functions and variables in right sequence
remove nested functions if possible
figure out how code execution happens, declaring variables in external vs internal.

triple click contenteditable on new fields go back to first field, use maybe input field instead, 
	may have to do with adding DOM node, the other fields work, they were innerHTML
	Using "?????" as placeholder for new content, had strange behavior when clicking to highlight all text, 
	had to use triple click whereas A-Z required only double click,
	good use stackoverflow question

update textarea to codemirror instance
what happens with 4 outcomes, update, cancel, add card, and delete card
current card and sidebar need fixing on card deletion
	if last card deleted move up one
	else card deleted move down one
need to have scroll on overflow for all three boxes, page document should not scroll 
lowercase names to keep tagging consistent
add fields needs an auto overflow
add alphabetical order filter and search bar
create a preferences window, you can change the sidebar categories, also include preferences object
long card titles overflow into snippet box
make cards rearrangable,
Undo delete button
when deleting all cards need to have a blank card in place to maintain layout
make object with color pallette for different styles and pass during eventlistener
was getting a [Violation] Forced reflow while executing JavaScript took 32ms,
	when click checkbox and then deselecting all checkboxes
	maybe redo code and fix, adding async where possible, or not complete update
change title name from card and maybe other fields
when adding or deleting card need to update safe snippets
	erases current progress during update, may have to do with cards all being undefined
	will need to make parameter to create new cards from html card generator
This can be fix by adding ids of slectall and deselect to queryall in the multibox function
	will need to clean up code first
	when using selectall, the snippet is not filled with multi fields until checkbox is clicked
	need to have a checkbox click populate snippet
want to save check box fields into safe snippet for keeping if needing to add or remove checked boxes
	create an active class for cards that have checkbox is you want persistence
	keep cards selected after update or add or delete

function text how to
make compatible with vs code
use other snippet editor's docs to add features
write natural language docs
talk about picture break down essential features first, reverse engineering
then write pseudo code for page during talk
indexed db for saving without upload json
maybe can improve ids for sidebar filters, in case multiple different files are brought in
make split js a bundled script, might be intefering with code

how to delete empty fields in array HTML fields filter out blank innertext
add main display all // must attach id to child of sidebarbox,
card language seperate arr 
make a currentSidebar variable with id, may not work becuase new fields are bing added and id number will be reset, 
	may actual innerTExt instead, will have to use that in sidebarObj though
sidebar and currentCard is getting reset after update, used click() on currentCard and currentSidebar
	content addition is not appearing other cards during edit,  setaddField in the setEventFunction to relocate current card value
adding snippets aren't updating, simply pushed new object and updated cards and sidebar
	get parent of target, used event.target.parentNode.id, important to put id at end
fix current card id and sidebar, not card0, use combo of lang and title, can you have spaces in id?, remove whitespace, returns and tabs
	can only have one id, trim() only does outside, can use replace /\s/g, "", might be expensive, keep counter global and only add new content tags.
	used replaced to fix for now
!!!!!!cards should take on id of parent encapsulation ,how to delete snippets, BE CAREFUL since ids are not consistent, 
	deleting based on id name could cause unintentional deletion
deleting new cards removing them by half each time 16 8 4 2 1, guiving unique ids fixed problem,  cause of problem `card${counter++}`.replace(/\s+/g, "")
create unique id system for current card and sidebar
	same name can cause lots of issues
update after adding a card
json input, have json load as soon as opening up input
use svg, put icons beside languages, use sprite sheet, generate css style sheet with object key and tag images with keys also
make the add card better with new object or proper constructor
edit multiple cards during an editing session, check setEventCards()
when switching cards while editing resets editing
setup function to make sure cards never share id, id can be more efficient and safer, will work as is// only a problem if mixing different snippet objects together
put a class in span elements with required images
fix naming conventions
	make checkbox bigger
	stopPropagation()
added pointer finger for buttons and cards
added multi select with background color change
Cancel update button 
when unchecking all boxes, currentcard is not reselected back to grey
reset everything on unclick
need to stop safesnippets from updating while boxes are checked 
add new tags not working on checked update, added addsetfield() in checkbox main function
when clicking checkbox render editable, only clicking does so during update, only clicking card in update shows add fields
make content edit when going from card to check and back to card
added line for fields to be visible again in both cancel and update button
when updating after check renders card hidden until checking again
maybe make delete card global in event card function, document.querySelectorAll(".deleteCard").forEach(el => el.addEventListener( 'click', deleteCard))
in loadSnippet(), will need to fix for just languages, is adding class to other array fields
cancel still shows when updating with checkbox, made again hidden during update click
multi checkbox for mass delete or content update, have a select all or select none
may need to fix for having multiple new cards out at once, add a counter for number ids, fixed during html generation
and resizable bars, with hand cursor type

PROBLEM
flex box was not rendering on page.
SOLUTION
left the style tag in a external css file, caused the page to break

PROBLEM
could not iterate through object
SOLUTION
was using dot notation on a variable, use square brackets

PROBLEM
document.querySelector('.card').click() //won't work in cards script find out why

PROBLEM
could not use innertext on items in a queryselectorall array
SOLUTION
was using getelementid on items, only need to prefix, ex el.innerText

PROBLEM
could not use function another script
SOLUTION
seperate script needs to load before, function hoisting doesn't seem to work 

PROBLEM
could not get event listener to execute
SOLUTION
document.querySelectorAll uses CSS syntax in field, eg document.querySelectorAll(".deleteCard") NOT ("deleteCard") for class

PROBLEM
could not get event listener to execute
SOLUTION
was using a parentElement to remove parent card, had <button class="deleteCard"><b>X</b></button>, 
the bold tag was creating an extra layer, intefering with button and card

PROBLEM
svgs won't set to size when done through inkscape
SOLUTION
????https://stackoverflow.com/a/39062462
not sure, different svgs will shrink, others won't
